# Blink & Catch

**Blink & Catch** is a fast-paced reaction game that uses AI-powered face tracking to turn your real-life blinks into in-game actions.
**Engine**: Unity
## How It Works
- A cube moves left and right at the top of the screen.
- When you blink, the AI detects it using face recognition and drops the cube.
- If the cube lands on a circle below, you score a point.
- The circle then repositions to a random new location, increasing the challenge.

## AI Integration
- The game uses real-time eye blink detection to trigger gameplay events.
- No keyboard or mouse required — your eyes are the controller.

## Objective
- Blink at the right moment to align the falling cube with the target circle.
- The more accurate your timing, the higher your score.

## Features
- Real-time face and blink detection.
- Randomized target movement after each successful drop.
- Simple yet addictive timing-based gameplay.
